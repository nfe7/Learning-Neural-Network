# Learning-Neural-Network

This notebook implements a neural network (using PyTorch) for predicting house sale prices in Brooklyn, NY, using real property sales data from 2023 to 2024. It covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, building a simple feedforward neural network, and training the model to predict sale prices.
